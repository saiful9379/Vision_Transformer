# 1. Train Vision Transformer model 
## __Preprocess the Data__

Which containt 4 classes: 

    1) berry 

    2) bird 

    3) dog 

    4) flower

In this class containts some outlier like berry class folder containt other object. defined those object data we can remove outlier.


## __Apply augmentation__

Run ```data_augmentation.py``` script
```py
python data_augmentation.py

```

## __Build Classifier which will be able to classify the input photo to one of the 4 classes__
Check the config file ```config.py``` script for data path as well as below this mention variable.
```
# Make sure the dataset path directory

DATASET_PATH = "/dataset"

EPOCHS = 20

```
Run.

```
python train_vit.py

```

## __training Graph__

this plot matrices will save into log directory.

## __Prove that your model is not overfitted__

Model Evaluation run ```vit_eval.py``` script,

```
python vit_eval.py

```
Evaluation Training model.
